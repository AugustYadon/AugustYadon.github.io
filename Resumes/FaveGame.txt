My favorite game right now is probably SuperHot VR. The obvious improvement would be adding more content, since it's relatively short. But that's a bland answer so I'll add context. I would like to add a level creator to it so that users can design new levels. To make sure this is succesful, you would want to keep in mind that the average user needs a simple interface and that the more hardcore users will want more depth. The difficulties would be hard to predict since I don't entirely know how the game is constructed under the hood. Some things I would do to make the level design tool would first be to let the user create the base level with drag and drop geometric shapes. ramps, cubes, walls, windows. Then you would add the non-static objects, these are start where they are places but can be moves by bullets or characters. Next you would place weapons wherever the player wants to put them. I prefer to not limit how many the player can put. If they player makes a game that has too many objects, make sure that the game handles that error and exits, but don't explicitly limit how many weapons, or characters the creator will use. The enemies would be the next step, i'd like the player to decide where to place them, which weapon(s) they have, how much health they have, and maybe how aggressive they are. Lastly You'd add some extra features like what text comes up on the screen when you win, or global time trial records, and allow others to easily download and vote much like the steam workshop environment.
