Dear Mr. Roiland (or whoever ends up reading this),

My name is August Yadon and I'm an electrical engineer/software developer who has spent my entire professional career making videogames alongside other software and hardware related jobs. I'm from Cleveland, OH (awesome place), and I left my last job in San Francisco to move back here while I create my own VR game and build a strong portfolio. I'm extremely self-motivated and driven to take a concept and find a way to make it a real game mechanic. Everything that I've built in the past year has been my own so I have a robust set of skills that I'm proud of. 
I think the gameplay programmer positions that you’ve listed are a perfect match for what I’m trying to get into. Now that I’m wrapping up and shipping my first project I’m beginning to search for a company that I admire and Squanch is the first place I’m looking. I’ve been doing 3D game development for 4 years, and I strongly believe that I can quickly adapt from Unity to Unreal as I have a solid foundation of how a 3D engine operates. Game Loops, shaders, 3D physics are all things that I’ve studied along the way.
I want to thank you for taking the time to read this cover letter and suggest that if you’d like to know more, please visit my website where I’ve given in depth walkthroughs of some of the more interesting small parts of my current project. I think you’d be impressed at how well thought out a lot of my code and game design strategies are. I would love to talk on the phone or in person about the jobs you have open and learn more about the company. 
Again, thanks for your time!
August
